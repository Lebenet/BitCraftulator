# OUTDATED
This project is (currently) out-of-date, it was created for and used in Alpha 2 and 3
Many upgrades could be done, and I will most likely start working on this again when 
1. I have access to the game, 2. They authorize access to their DB again, and 3. I simply have the time for it

As of for now, I recommend checking out BitPlanner or BitHub

# BitCraftulator
BitCraft Craft Calculator Helper

## How to install:

Download either:
- AppWithoutRuntime.zip, then extract

Open the folder, install the .NET8.0 runtime on your own if you don't have it, then go to the "App" subfolder and run the BitCraftulator.exe

- AppWithRUntime.zip, then extract

Open the folder, install the provided runtime, then go to the "App" subfolder and run the BitCraftulator.exe


If you want to edit the recipes, open the Recipes.json file, but remember that the program won't work if the json format isn't respected
